This page is a curated selection of my long-form generative artworks. In my [artistic exploration and practice](https://stc.github.io/), I delve into the philosophical aspects of computation and the cognitive aspects of the mind. While new technologies emerge and fade rapidly, the overarching purpose — understanding ourselves and our place in the world — remains as crucial as ever. I find it fascinating that humanity invents and explores technological, ritualistic, or artistic tools to frame problems and devise solutions. I'm deeply impressed by our ancestors who developed ways to comprehend our environment and our relationship with reality. I see art as an autonomous expression of the aspects above, that acts as a gateway to our innate nature, aiding in understanding ourselves, our emotions, and our connections with others.

m0-n0 is a realtime generative artwork, composed of deconstructed screen space. The process is based on a recursive noise function, that is altered by low-level manipulations of a fragment shader. The sound synthesis is closely related with the glitches and flaws of the unfolding image architecture. Each colour scheme activates a different set of sound generators and filter modules. The resulting composition is an audiovisual environment that slowly transforms its elements into a blend of auditive sensations and autonomous pixel configurations.

sh3ll is an audiovisual artwork created with code, algorithms and blockchain metadata. The visual structure is inspired by natural processes that can be replicated through computational methods. The sounds are generated on the fly, based on microsound synthesis. The colour palette is changing gradually, according to the iteration number of the minted token. Individual pieces belong to a larger colour transition that can be viewed over the whole series.

Metapoetry.

Following the traditions of concrete poetry, cut-up methodology, typewriter art and conceptual experiments, this piece is transforming metadata of generative token [#22568](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22568) into visual poetry. The image structure is built from a randomly selected iteration of [“L-Template”](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22568) by reading the available drawing instructions from its features and combining them with the name of its owner. The arrangement of the letters is based on this formula. This rule also becomes the title of the rendered piece, which can be seen on the bottom of the scene. The titles are supplemented with the names of the collectors, who become co-authors of the final composition. Where there is no registered fx-hash user name for the selected token, “anonymous collector” will be displayed instead as the author. Being an artwork that is built on the features of another token, L-Poem intends to be a meta-token, a quasi-tautological, entangled entity whose existence is ensured by the immutable ledger environment.

r3s0 is a real-time generative artwork, investigating algorithmic shapes, colors and slowly transformic movements. As I am primarily interested in the philosophical aspects of computation (entropy, simulations, time, etc.), this piece focuses on the visual aspects of a custom, recursive noise function.

C-Life is an audiovisual artwork featuring abstract, generative landscapes. The visual setting comprises a light source and several vibrant cascading elements arranged in front of this radiant light. The gradual movement of these objects evokes the sensation of an opal-like glass surface, giving the impression that the display is melting due to the warmth emitted by the inner light.In the series, the palette of the landscapes gradually shifts from a small range of colors to a wider array of palette pool along the ids of the tokens. As more pieces are created in a single transaction batch, there's an increase in the speed and quantity of elements moving, resulting in a greater number of layers and sonic vibrations. The letter “C” pronounced as “sea” within the title encompasses all words that start with the letter “C”. This compression allows for an expansive and limitless range of interpretations for the scene.
