## Limitations

- **Local Development** - since the site uses XMLHttpRequest to grab content, a local web server will be needed if you want to test things locally, e.g. `python -m http.server`. However, editing files directly on a server/GitHub is part of the convenience/fun.


## Todo

- add descriptions & artworks
