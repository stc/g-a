This page is a curated selection of my long-form generative artworks. In my artistic exploration and practice, I delve into the philosophical aspects of computation and the cognitive aspects of the mind. While new technologies emerge and fade rapidly, the overarching purpose — understanding ourselves and our place in the world — remains as crucial as ever. I find it fascinating that humanity invents and explores technological, ritualistic, or artistic tools to frame problems and devise solutions. I'm deeply impressed by our ancestors who developed ways to comprehend our environment and our relationship with reality. I see art as an autonomous expression of the aspects above, that acts as a gateway to our innate nature, aiding in understanding ourselves, our emotions, and our connections with others.

r3s0 is a real-time generative artwork, investigating algorithmic shapes, colors and slowly transformic movements. As I am primarily interested in the philosophical aspects of computation (entropy, simulations, time, etc.), this piece focuses on the visual aspects of a custom, recursive noise function.

C-Life is an audiovisual artwork featuring abstract, generative landscapes. The visual setting comprises a light source and several vibrant cascading elements arranged in front of this radiant light. The gradual movement of these objects evokes the sensation of an opal-like glass surface, giving the impression that the display is melting due to the warmth emitted by the inner light.In the series, the palette of the landscapes gradually shifts from a small range of colors to a wider array of palette pool along the ids of the tokens. As more pieces are created in a single transaction batch, there's an increase in the speed and quantity of elements moving, resulting in a greater number of layers and sonic vibrations. The letter “C” pronounced as “sea” within the title encompasses all words that start with the letter “C”. This compression allows for an expansive and limitless range of interpretations for the scene.
