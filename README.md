| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

## Limitations

- **Local Development** - since the site uses XMLHttpRequest to grab content, a local web server will be needed if you want to test things locally, e.g. `python -m http.server`. However, editing files directly on a server/GitHub is part of the convenience/fun.


## Todo

- add descriptions & artworks
