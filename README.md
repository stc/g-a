| r3s0 is a real-time generative artwork, investigating algorithmic shapes, colors and slowly transformic movements. As I am primarily interested in the philosophical aspects of computation (entropy, simulations, time, etc.), this piece focuses on the visual aspects of a custom, recursive noise function. I recently began using WebGL shaders to expand my practice beyond the regular canvas, manipulating pixels and shapes in a more direct manner. | Custom Software, WebGL, 2023|


## Limitations

- **Local Development** - since the site uses XMLHttpRequest to grab content, a local web server will be needed if you want to test things locally, e.g. `python -m http.server`. However, editing files directly on a server/GitHub is part of the convenience/fun.
